## [Unreleased](https://github.com/quartiq/stabilizer/compare/v0.9.0...HEAD)

### Added
* Support added for pounder v1.2
* Serial terminal is available on USB for settings configurations

### Changed
* Broker is no longer configured at compile time, but is maintained in device memory

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/quartiq/stabilizer/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0)

### Fixed

* Fixed a defect where powering up with Pounder attached would cause an internal panic.

### Changed

* `idsp` crate update to 0.10: `lockin` now uses a double second order lowpass.
* The `batch_size` field in the the UDP stream frame now contains the number of batches
  not the number of samples per batch. It has been renamed to `batches`.
 * All MQTT clients upgraded and APIs updated.
 * MQTT broker may now be specified via DNS hostnames
 * `hitl/streaming.py` no longer requires a prefix
 * Streaming now supports UDP multicast addresses

* [breaking] MSRV bumped to 1.63 (`array_from_fn` via `enum_iterator`)
* [breaking] Bumped dependencies on `miniconf`, `minimq` leading to changes in the `Miniconf` settings API
* Bumped HAL dependency to fix a crucial I2C bug
* Added gain limits for `iir_coefficients`
* Added a IIR transfer function plotting tool
* Fixed a bug in the Python telemetry client that led to no data being returned
